In large-scale engineering projects, supply chain management can become a critical bottleneck without absolute traceability. The challenge for TAIMEC involved centralizing and categorizing thousands of technical components—ranging from industrial valves and precision instrumentation to complex piping accessories—that previously lacked a unified data structure. The goal was to transform a massive inventory into a functional, intelligent database for strategic decision-making.

I developed a comprehensive technical matrix designed for the identification and management of thousands of industrial assets. I implemented a robust data architecture that categorizes each element by technical specifications, material standards, and operational criticality. This solution enables instantaneous search and inventory control for complex fittings, ensuring that procurement and maintenance teams have access to precise, technical information in real-time.

This database did more than just organize physical inventory; it optimized the entire supply chain workflow for the company. By standardizing the identification of valves and instruments, we significantly reduced manual errors in material selection and improved response times for industrial assembly projects. It stands as a clear example of how data management applied to engineering can generate efficiency and order in high-complexity industrial environments.
