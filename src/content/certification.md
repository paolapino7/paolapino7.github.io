The truck scale certification process in industrial logistics is often hindered by manual data entry and slow documentation workflows. The challenge was to modernize this system, transitioning from traditional registration to a fully automated digital solution that ensures accuracy and speed. This project required a blend of web development for data management and 3D engineering for component visualization.

I developed a centralized web solution using JavaScript, HTML, and API management to digitize the certification lifecycle. By automating the generation of digital certificates, I eliminated the need for manual registrations, reducing human error and optimizing administrative times. Complementing the software side, I designed and developed 3D components, integrating mechanical precision with digital tracking to provide a holistic view of the system’s assets.

This project demonstrates my ability to identify operational bottlenecks and solve them through custom software development. It highlights my versatility in handling front-end technologies and 3D modeling tools to create tools that are not only functional but also essential for the digital transformation of industrial logistics.
