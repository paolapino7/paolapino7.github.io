Harmony Audio wanted to enter the competitive smart speaker market with a product that addressed growing privacy concerns while delivering exceptional audio quality. Unlike tech-focused competitors, they envisioned a device that would appeal to design-conscious consumers who value both form and function. The challenge was creating a speaker that looked beautiful when silent but came alive with intuitive interactions when needed.

Our design process began with extensive material exploration and acoustic testing to achieve the optimal balance between visual appeal and sound performance. We developed a unique fabric wrap system that conceals the speaker grille while allowing clear audio transmission. 

The Harmony Speaker launched to critical acclaim, winning the Red Dot Design Award and selling out its initial production run within six weeks. Audio reviewers praised its warm, room-filling sound, while design publications highlighted its sophisticated aesthetic.
