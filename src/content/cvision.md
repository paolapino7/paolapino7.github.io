This work presented the development of an assistive prototype for people with low vision, designed to identify obstacles and gaps in real time by means of artificial vision and machine learning, contributing to their safe and independent mobility on sidewalks. The main motivation lay in the difficulties faced by visually impaired people when moving around unfamiliar environments such as sidewalks and non-adapted public spaces, where obstacles and gaps represent a significant risk. The prototype used a Raspberry Pi 4 as the processing unit, along with a RazerKiyo 720p camera for image capture. A real-time object detection model was implemented using TensorFlow Lite, optimized to run efficiently on the Raspberry Pi. Real-time audio alerts were generated by identifying obstacles such as poles, fire hydrants, signpost tubes, ground level advertising and large rocks, as well as holes, alerting the user to take precautions when walking. Several tests were performed with the prototype on the sidewalks of Quito - Ecuador, evaluating the performance of the neural networks and the system with the webcam to observe the performance of object detection, reaching an identification of approximately 90% of both obstacles and holes.The prototype was created as a complement to the white cane, without replacing it, promoting a robust assistive approach, this project contributes to the development of assistive technologies accessible to the Ecuadorian population. The results obtained showed that the prototype can reduce the risk of accidents and promote independence in daily activities.
