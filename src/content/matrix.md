In large-scale engineering projects, supply chain management and field execution can become critical bottlenecks without absolute traceability. For TAIMEC, I led the technical coordination and QA/QC of a 7-level industrial detergent plant, ensuring that every stage of the mechanical assembly aligned perfectly with P&ID diagrams. The core challenge was centralizing and categorizing thousands of technical components—from industrial valves to precision instrumentation—to transform a massive inventory into an intelligent system for strategic decision-making.

I developed a comprehensive technical matrix that served as the backbone for the plant's logistics, optimizing the flow from packing lists to final installation. This solution enabled instantaneous search and inventory control for complex fittings, ensuring that procurement and maintenance teams had access to precise technical information in real-time. Beyond data management, I took an active role in the field, using Navisworks and SolidWorks to identify and correct design interferences on-site, leading corrective actions with the operational staff to maintain project integrity.

By standardizing the identification of thousands of assets and validating the exact location of sensors and valves, I significantly reduced manual errors and improved response times for the assembly process. This project stands as a clear example of my ability to apply data management to heavy engineering, ensuring the integrity of complex process lines through a combination of digital architecture and hands-on operational leadership.
