In high-stakes industrial environments, managing technical certifications and project progress manually often leads to operational bottlenecks. The challenge was to replace a traditional, error-prone recording system with a robust digital ecosystem capable of tracking Welder Logs and certification validity in real-time. This required a solution that could handle complex technical data while remaining accessible for field supervisors and project managers.

I developed an advanced automation suite using VBA Macros and Power BI to centralize and visualize critical workforce data. The system features a custom logic that monitors welder accreditations, triggering visual alerts before certifications expire to ensure compliance and prevent downtime. By integrating these automated logs with interactive dashboards, I transformed raw operational data into actionable insights, providing a "single source of truth" for the entire project lifecycle.

The implementation of this system significantly reduced manual data entry errors and optimized the accreditation workflow. The Power BI dashboards offered the management team instant visibility into work-in-progress metrics, allowing for data-driven decision-making and more precise resource allocation. This project serves as a prime example of how tailored software solutions can bring Industry 4.0 efficiency to traditional heavy industry processes.
