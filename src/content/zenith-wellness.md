The Zenith Wellness App project began with extensive user research to understand the pain points of existing wellness applications. Through interviews with 50+ users and competitive analysis, we identified that most wellness apps felt overwhelming and lacked personalization. Users wanted a single platform that could adapt to their changing needs without feeling prescriptive or judgmental.

Our design process focused on creating an intuitive onboarding experience that learns from user preferences without being intrusive. We developed a modular interface system where users could customize their dashboard based on their current wellness goals. 

The final product increased user engagement by 240% compared to the client's previous app, with 89% of users completing the onboarding process. The app launched to critical acclaim and was featured in Apple's "Apps We Love" section, leading to over 500K downloads in the first month.
