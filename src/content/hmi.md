Engineering precision requires a bridge between complex mathematical models and physical hardware execution. This project unifies two high-level control applications into a comprehensive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) suite, showcasing a full spectrum of mechatronic skills. The challenge was to create a tool capable of predicting theoretical behavior in power electronics and managing real-time physical variables in thermal systems.The first component of the suite focuses on Power Electronics Simulation. Developed in MATLAB, this HMI automates the design of Buck Converters. By inputting initial values, the system calculates critical component parameters, determines the PID controller’s transfer function, and visualizes stability through dynamic frequency response graphs. The second project transitions into Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Control. Interfacing MATLAB with Arduino, I developed a thermal control station where users can dynamically tune setpoints (SP) and PID constants (Kp, Ki, Kd) to stabilize a physical temperature plant in real-time.This unified platform demonstrates my ability to handle the complete lifecycle of a control project: from the abstract mathematical modeling of electronic converters to the practical synchronization of sensors and actuators. It highlights a deep understanding of feedback control theory, providing an intuitive interface for managing complex industrial-grade processes.
