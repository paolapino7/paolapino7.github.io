The Laboratory of Reverse Engineering and Prototyping needed a digital bridge to connect its advanced technical capabilities with both the academic community and strategic government partners. The primary challenge was to showcase a complex ecosystem—ranging from high-level research personnel to active projects with the OEI (Organization of Ibero-American States) and the Secretariat of Education—within a single, intuitive interface. We aimed to transform a technical space into an accessible digital hub for innovation and service delivery.

We developed a comprehensive web architecture using Odoo, specifically designed to highlight the laboratory’s specialized services in 3D printing, laser cutting, and robotic prototyping. The platform was structured to provide clear visibility into ongoing research initiatives, detailing the impact of our collaborations with national and international organizations. We prioritized technical storytelling, using dedicated sections to introduce the expert staff and the laboratory’s core objectives, ensuring that potential partners could easily understand our technological reach.

The platform successfully digitized the laboratory's presence, serving as the central point of contact for educational outreach and technical training. It played a crucial role in managing 4.0 technology workshops for students and teachers, effectively bridging the gap between advanced engineering resources and community development. While the platform is no longer active due to external changes, it established a vital precedent for digital transparency and service accessibility in the field of reverse engineering.
