Artifact Coffee Roasters approached us as they transitioned from a small local operation to a regional brand with wholesale ambitions. Their challenge was communicating their commitment to ethical sourcing and artisanal quality while appealing to both coffee enthusiasts and casual drinkers. The brand needed to stand out in a crowded market dominated by both corporate giants and numerous indie roasters.

We developed a visual identity rooted in the concept of "honest craft" – celebrating the human touch in every step of the coffee process. The logo combines a geometric coffee bean with hand-drawn elements, symbolizing the balance between precision and artistry. The color palette draws from natural coffee tones enhanced with earthy accent colors inspired by origin countries. Typography pairs a custom wordmark with clean, readable fonts that work across all touchpoints.
